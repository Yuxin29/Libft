char	*ft_strrchr(const char *s, int c)
{
	xxx
}

The strrchr() function returns a pointer to the last occurrence of
       the character c in the string s.

The strchr() and strrchr() functions return a pointer to the
       matched character or NULL if the character is not found.  The
       terminating null byte is considered part of the string, so that if
       c is specified as '\0', these functions return a pointer to the
       terminator.
